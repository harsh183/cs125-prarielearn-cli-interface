# CLI Interface for CS 125 Prarirelearn

A web bot to let you pretend that prarielearn can be done via commandline in your text editor of choice (micro, vim, emacs, butterflies etc.).
### Login

There is an `account.txt` file you can enter your net id and password. If you don't
want to do this, just delete the file and the bot will prompt you to enter it yourself 
into the site yourself.

### TODO

1. Generalize this for other courses
2. Make this work with past hw solutions
3. Make this support Spring 19 and later sems.
